    p Welcome to the Deconstructed API documentation.  Deconstructed uses data you send to automatically create profiles of each user using your websites or applications. Through a continuous process called consociation, we use data you send to map a user to the different cookies, apps and services from which you send data about them.
    p Deconstructedâ€™s user profiles can be searched in real-time to drive in-app or on-site personalization and contextualization, to drive user-level dashboarding and reporting, or to power the activities of other services in your stack.  
    p Our Platform also provides a system of rules-based triggers and notifications which allow you to notify or push updates to any other services when a user meets the conditions you define in a rule.
